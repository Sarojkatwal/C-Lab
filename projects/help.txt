This is a project on card game named SATRA.There are four players in the game.They can choose at most 5 cards.If the sum of their cards number
is  more than seventen the player will be out.If the sum of the cards value  is exactly equal to 17 the the player is declared  as winner. If 
sum of his cards number is near to 17 before withdrawing 5 cards he can pass the  turn to withdraw the card to the another  player.Similar 
process is repeated for 4  players.At last sum  of card number the  players who  are not out is compared. All the result are lessthan 17.The 
player  whose card's  value's sum is more is declared as winner.
